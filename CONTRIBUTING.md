# 🤝 Contributing

Thank you for considering and taking the time to contribute! 💖 

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this _free_
series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

The following are guidelines for contributing to this project.

1. Fork and clone the repo.

2. Create a branch for your PR with `git checkout -b your-branch-name`

> Tip: Keep your `master` branch pointing at the original repository and make
> pull requests from branches on your fork. To do this, run:
>
> ```
> git remote add upstream https://github.com/Blocship/star_book.git
> git fetch upstream
> git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/master master
> ```
>
> This will add the original repository as a "remote" called "upstream," Then
> fetch the git information from that remote, then set your local `master`
> branch to use the upstream master branch whenever you run `git pull`. Then you
> can make all of your pull request branches based on this `master` branch.
> Whenever you want to update your version of `master`, do a regular `git pull`.

3. Open Issue, discuss what you are planning to do.

4. Make changes and create Pull Request.

## Code GuideLines

- Put widget in shared folder if the widget is shared between 2 or more screens.
- Make a class _Private if it is not shared or does not needed to be exposed for other classes
- Prefer `const` over `final` for variables.
- Prefer to create `const constructors` for immutable classes.
- Keep the code loosely coupled and highly cohesive.
- Never use dependencies directly in the widgets, prefer to create a service class and use it in the widget.
- Annotate with `@override` for all the methods that are overridden from the super class.
- Never leave the data types as `dynamic` or `Object`.
- Use OOP concepts for code organization and reuse.
- Prefer named parameters over positional parameters.
- (Optional) Prefer `relative-import` over `absolute-import` for (our own) file imports. Use `absolute-import` for importing from the packages. [This extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=luanpotter.dart-import) might help you with this. 
- Use snake case for file names.
- The filename should correspond to the name of the primary class in the file.
- Names of files that contains widgets that take the whole screen should end with the suffix: _screen.dart, for example, signup or login takes up the whole screen for authentication.
- Use Camel Case convention for class and enum names.
- Name (classes, variables, functions, modules) in a meaningful name which describe its functionality.
- Make sure that all .dart files are formatted using flutter format command.
