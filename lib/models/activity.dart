        Today, I had a great time as this was the 1st day of the year. Once again, I took resolutions for the year which I am going to follow(:P) or at least try to follow(:O). Today, I started my day with some exercise and healthy breakfast. Then, spent the rest of my day with my family and which I really enjoyed. At the end of the day, we had a special dinner made by my mother. Today was the perfect beginning of the year. Hurray!! Goodbye Diary...

        Dear Diary,
        I did nothing much today. I woke up at 7 in the morning as usual. It was raining heavily, so I didn't go to college. I know it was just an excuse and I regret it. During the day time, I did nothing other than watching YouTube videos. At 5 in the evening, I went to the market to grab something to eat, and all of a sudden, I saw my professor sitting opposite me. I was really embarrassed as I already informed him that I wasn't feeling good and won't be able to come to class today. Sorry again, but see how Karma works. I will make sure to avoid such excuses from today. God, help me and forgive me. Lessons learned: Don't lie or make excuses.

        Today is the last date for report submission of all my theory subjects on which I have been working lately for the last 1 month. During the course time, I consulted my college friends & professors regarding this, we attended our last meeting today discussing the closing points which needs to be present in the report. Ahhh, that was a long discussion. I spent the whole day giving some final touches to the reports and submitted all of them just 15 mins ago. I got really tired by all this stuff and I am in need of some real sleep. Goodbye diary. See you tom...

I'm taking a course offered by `deeplearning.ai` at Coursera, and this is a really great course having Andrew Ng as an instructor. He explains hard concepts which such ease that anyone would grasp the knowledge. Well, I finished some of my other pieces of stuff as well. But nothing more exciting than learning ML. Bye-bye...
